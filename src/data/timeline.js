That led me to find a piece of hardware called the Titan Two and a language called GPC, where I developed code to take motion control inputs of jumping, walking, crouching to output the neccesary movement commands, as well as squeezing a resistance ring to attack enemies. It was at this point that I knew I could pursue this as a career."
