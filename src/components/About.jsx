  Hello there, I'm Tiernan, and I've been immersed in the world of programming since I was 15. Coding has always been more than just a skill for me; it's a tool to transforming ideas into finished products, whether they're practical solutions or just quirky experiments.

  Self-taught and driven by curiosity, I've paved my own path in software development. From the early days of wild experimentation to the serious projects I'm currently engaged in, my journey has been about pushing boundaries and embracing the possibilities that code offers.
    <br /> <br />
  The idea that I can just make anything I can dream of has always been a thrill for me. For the past 5 years, I've been my own teacher, constantly learning and I love different technologies and I wish I could master them all.

  As a frontend developer, I specialize in crafting seamless user experiences and translating ideas into visually appealing designs.

  Attention to detail is my forte. It's not just about writing lines of code; it's about creating solutions that are not only functional but also practical and efficient.

    <br /> <br/>
  I believe in the 'dream it, build it' philosophy. My portfolio showcases the progression from those early crazy ideas to the robust projects I'm handling now. It's a journey marked by continuous improvement and a commitment to excellence.

  In this fast-paced tech world, my commitment to learning remains unwavering.

  Beyond the code, I value collaboration and effective communication. Understanding end-users and delivering solutions that exceed expectations are principles I hold dear.
  <br /> <br/>
  Looking forward, my goal is simple: to keep getting better at what I do. The journey ahead involves exploring new technologies, learning all that I can, and 'just doing the work' no matter what.

  So, I thank you for taking the time to check out my website and I hope you enjoy.
</p>
